# Define a function named largest_difference that takes a list of numbers as its only 
# parameter.
# Your function should compute and return the difference between the largest and 
# smallest number in the list.
# For example, the call largest_difference([1, 2, 3]) should return 2 because 3 - 1 is 2.
# You may assume that no numbers are smaller or larger than -100 and 100.


# def largest_difference(n):
#    i=0
#    great=n[0]
#    small=n[0]
#    while i<len(n):
#       if n[i]>great:
#          great=n[i]
#       if n[i]<small:
#          small=n[i]
#       i+=1
#    print("great:",great)
#    print("small:",small)
#    difference=great-small
#    return "difference:",difference
# print(largest_difference([3,5,2,9,6,1]))
