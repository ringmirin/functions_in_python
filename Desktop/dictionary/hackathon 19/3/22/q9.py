# In computing, the collection of four bits is called a nibble. Chef defines a program as:
# Good, if it takes exactly X nibbles of memory, where X is a positive integer.
# Not Good, otherwise. Given a program that takes N bits of memory, determines whether 
# it is Good or Not Good.
# Input Format
# First-line will contain T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
# The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer N, the number of 
# bits taken by the program.
# Output Format
# For each test case, output Good or Not Good in a single line. You may print each 
# character of Good or Not Good in uppercase or lowercase (for example, GoOd, GOOD, good 
# will be considered identical).
# Sample Input 1 
# 8
# 17
# 52
# 3

# Sample Output 1 
# Good
# Not Good
# Good
# Not Good

# bits=int(input("total number of bits: "))
# if bits%4==0:
#    print("GOOD")
# else:
#    print("NOT GOOD")
