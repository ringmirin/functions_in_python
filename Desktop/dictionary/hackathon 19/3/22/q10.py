# Vasya likes the number 239. Therefore, he considers a number pretty if its last digit 
# is 2, 3 or 9. Vasya wants to watch the numbers between L and R (both inclusive), so he 
# asked you to determine how many pretty numbers are in this range. Can you help him?
# Input
# The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test 
# cases. The description of T test cases follows.
# The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers L and R.
# Output
# For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of pretty 
# numbers between L and R.
# Sample Input 1 

# 1 10
# 11 33

# Sample Output 1 
# 3
# 8

# Explanation
# Example case 1: The pretty numbers between 1 and 10 are 2, 3, and 9.
# Example case 2: The pretty numbers between 11 and 33 are 12, 13, 19, 22, 23, 29, 32, and 33.

# left=int(input("enter the leading number: "))

# j=0

# list1=[]
# count=0
# while j<len(list):
#    sum=list[j]%10
#    list1.append(sum)
#    if list1[j]==2 or list1[j]==3 or list1[j]==9:
#       count+=1
#    j+=1
# print(count)
